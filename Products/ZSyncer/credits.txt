ZSyncer Credits
---------------
see http://sourceforge.net/projects/zsyncer for current contact info.

ZSyncer is based on Gregor Heine's Client-Server product.
Not much code remains of that, but thanks for getting us going!

Current Head Tinkerer: Paul M. Winkler
 
Contributors (alphabetical order):

 Samuel Brauer submitted some bugs and patches for 0.6.

 Robert Brewer wrote an ASPN python cookbook recipe that 
 we swiped to do dynamic imports.

 Gregor Heine wrote Client-Server and helped out on version 0.3.

 Amos Latteier at Zope Corp. wrote xmlrpc Basic Authentication.

 Dieter Maurer wrote patches to improve cmf support and provided
 an alternative to xmlrpc using ZPublisher.Client.

 Chris McDonough reminded Andy about xmlrpc basic auth.

 Andy McKay was Head Tinkerer prior to the 0.5 release
 and did a whole bunch of stuff.

 Alan Milligan fixed the SSL support for xmlrpc basic auth, and for
 0.6.1 contributed ConnectionMgr to provide yet another transport
 because xmlrpc is broken and ZPublisher.Client doesn't support SSL.
 For 0.7, Alan provided big patches to implement push/pull syncing and
 the "touch" feature.

 Sascha Ottolski contributed a patch to make it easier
 to add the Sync tab to new classes, and did some work on
 improving support for ZClass definitions.

 Charlie Reiman helped out a lot during the 0.5 releases.

 Mikhail L. Titov added a feature to remove talkback comments.

 Joachim Werner came up with some cool UI suggestions for 0.3, thanks.

 Chris Withers killed off zLOG.
